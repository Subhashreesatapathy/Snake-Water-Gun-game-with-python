The "Snake Water Gun" game is a variation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
In this game, instead of Rock, Paper, and Scissors, we have Snake, Water, and Gun. Each choice beats one of the other choices and loses to the other.

Here's a brief description of the rules:-
* Snake beats Water (as a snake can swim in water).
* Water beats Gun (water can put out a gun's fire or damage it).
* Gun beats Snake (a gun can shoot a snake).
* The game is played between two players (or a player and the computer), and the goal is to choose an option that beats the opponent's choice.
* Play a game where the player competes against the computer to choose between Snake (🐍), Water (💧), and Gun (🔫), with each choice beating one option and losing to another.

Rules

Water (💧) beats Gun (🔫)
